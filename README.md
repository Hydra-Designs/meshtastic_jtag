## Features
- Works with any ESP32 Devkit C compatible board  
- Support for OLED (front) and GPS (back)  
- Compatible with ebyte e22-900m22s LORA module  
- Built in 915MHz monopole antenna   

## Project status
- Gerbers are not tested and schematic has not been reviewed  
- Antenna matching network needs to be optimized  

## Assembly instructions
- Gerber files are in the /gerber/ directory, they are plotted in a format that can be directly uploaded to JLPCB    
- When ordering from JLCPCB don't forget to tick "specify a location" under "remove order number" so that the JLC PCB number is at the PCB back side  
- Assembly should be pretty self-explanatory, minimum hardware requirement is the ESP32 Devkit and the e22-900m22s LORA module with the two decoupling capacitors  
- OLED display goes on the PCB front side  
- NEO6M GPS module goes on the PCB back side  
- The matching network needs fine tuning, for now you should not place C3 and C4 and add a short in place of L1 (small blob of solder)
